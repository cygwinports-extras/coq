ldesc: "Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal 
language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and 
theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development 
of machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the 
formalization of programming languages semantics, the formalization of 
mathematics, and teaching."
